# Mozart Root Presenter

This directory contains the Root Presenter, a service which binds view trees
to a renderer and provides input.

This application must be run within an environment that includes the
compositor and view manager.  If those services are not available,
they may need to be bootstrapped prior to running it.

See also the Launch program which is used to launch a view provider
application and ask the Presenter in its environment to display it.

## USAGE

This program should not be run directly.

Use file:///system/apps/launch instead.
