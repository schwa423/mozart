# Synthy

TODO(MZ-??): unimplemented.

Sometimes you might want a shape that sighs audibly when you stretch it or
belches when you poke it.

Sometimes you want to analyze the frequencies of an incoming audio signal, and
use the result to animate the outlines of a Sketchy stroke.

Sometimes you just want to hear a resonant filter sweep.

Synthy will not disappoint you.
