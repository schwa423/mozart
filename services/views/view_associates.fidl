// View associates are trusted components that are attached to a view manager
// instance with the purpose of offering additional services to views and
// view trees registered beyond the basic operations performed by the
// view manager itself.  Associates may be used to implement input,
// accessibility, editing, and other capabilities.
//
// Associates are coupled to a view manager instance for the entire life
// of that view manager.  Associates cannot be dynamically added or removed
// since applications rely on the services that they offer and expect them
// to be available for the lifetime of their views.  Moreover, all views and
// view trees registered with a particular view manager instance share
// the same set of associates.
//
// This mechanism is designed to avoid a potential explosion in complexity
// if all features which depend on the state of views were implemented
// in one place.
